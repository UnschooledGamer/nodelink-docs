# HELLOOOOOOOOOOO WORLD! 👋

Welcome to the **NodeLink** documentation!

If you are here, you are probably looking for an audio server that flows with your code. You want something that feels natural, something that you can tinker with, break, and fix again.

**You are in the right place.**

NodeLink was born from a simple desire: to understand and master every detail of an audio server. It is **100% Node.js**, lightweight, modular, and built with passion.

<Callout type="info" title="The Philosophy">
  It doesn’t try to reinvent the wheel — it just makes it spin in our own rhythm.
</Callout>

## NodeLink? Why though? Seriously, why?

We love the existing options. Truly. But sometimes, you just want to build in the language you speak every day.

We built NodeLink because we wanted a server that felt like home. We wanted to peek under the hood, see the gears turning, and understand the magic of audio processing without switching contexts.

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="We speak your language 💛" id="js">
    If you write your bot in **JavaScript** or **TypeScript**, NodeLink feels like a natural extension of your project. It fits right into your existing ecosystem, making debugging and contributing a breeze.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sources? Handled. 🎵" id="sources">
    We aim for simplicity. NodeLink handles the complexities of various source managers internally, so you can focus on playing music rather than fighting with configuration files and access tokens.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Stability First 💪" id="stability">
    We utilize a **worker-based architecture**. This ensures that heavy tasks like parsing playlists happen in separate processes, keeping your main audio loop smooth and uninterrupted.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

### The Real Truth

It's about **control** and **knowledge**.

You can go deeper into anything here. If you don't know how something works, **go deep**. Learn it. Imagine it. Search for it. Run after it. Find it.

> If you don't seek knowledge, it won't just fall into your hands.

We built this so you can read the code, understand the stack traces, and realize that **you can do anything**. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. The code is open. The door is open. Come in and build something amazing. 💙

## Let's get you running

Enough talking, let's make some noise. NodeLink requires only Node.js, which runs on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Prerequisites
    
    Before we start, make sure you have **Node.js (v22+)** and **Git** installed.
    
    <Tabs items={['Windows', 'Linux', 'macOS']}>
      <Tab value="Windows">
        The easiest way is using `winget` in PowerShell:
        ```powershell
        winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
        winget install Git.Git
        ```
        *Alternatively, download the installers from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).*
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="Linux">
        Using a package manager (Ubuntu/Debian example):
        ```bash
        # Install Git
        sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y
        
        # Install Node.js 22.x
        curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
        sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="macOS">
        If you have **Homebrew** installed, it's a breeze:
        ```bash
        brew install node
        brew install git
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Clone the Magic
    
    Bring the project to your machine.
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PerformanC/NodeLink.git
    cd NodeLink
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Install Dependencies
    
    Install the project dependencies using your preferred package manager.
    
    <Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
      <Tab value="npm">
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="yarn">
        ```bash
        yarn install
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="pnpm">
        ```bash
        pnpm install
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="bun">
        ```bash
        bun install
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Config & Fly
    
    Copy the default configuration and start the server.
    
    <Tabs items={['Bash (Linux/macOS)', 'PowerShell (Windows)', 'CMD (Windows)']}>
      <Tab value="Bash (Linux/macOS)">
        ```bash
        cp config.default.js config.js
        npm run start
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="PowerShell (Windows)">
        ```powershell
        Copy-Item config.default.js -Destination config.js
        npm run start
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="CMD (Windows)">
        ```cmd
        copy config.default.js config.js
        npm run start
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>
